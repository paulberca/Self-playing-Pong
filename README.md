# Computer-controlled Pong

This is a simple Pong game implemented using Pygame, featuring computer-controlled paddles.

## Gameplay

- The ball moves across the screen, bouncing off the top and bottom edges and gradually increasing its speed.
- The paddles predict the ball's future position and intercept it.
- The game ends when the ball passes either paddle, and the winner is displayed.
